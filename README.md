## Introduction
This project was made as an entry in Kappa Theta Pi's internal hackathon. The purpose of this project was to provide a way for people to schedule out their day of studying, eating, etc. and keep everything in one succint location. This project is a way for people with trouble keeping track of their daily tasks to properly maintain their health by reminding themselves to take breaks and relax, eat, exercise, or whatever else they think they are forgetting to do regularly.

## How to Use
The best/easiest way to visualize this project is through Visual Studio Code. Through this software you can install the "Live Server" extension allowing you to use a secondary click on the index.html file and click the option "open with live server". This will create a new tab in your browser to allow you to open the project.
