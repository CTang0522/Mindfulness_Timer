## Introduction
This project was made as an entry in Kappa Theta Pi's internal hackathon. The purpose of this project was to provide a way for people to schedule out their day of studying, eating, etc. and keep everything in one succint location. This project is a way for people with trouble keeping track of their daily tasks to properly maintain their health by reminding themselves to take breaks and relax, eat, exercise, or whatever else they think they are forgetting to do regularly.
